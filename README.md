## 📋 Executive Summary
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. This project leverages **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to perform a granular analysis of patient health records, aiming to identify the most significant indicators of heart attack risk.

By querying a dataset of over 8,000 patients, we explored the relationship between **Medical History** (Diabetes, Hypertension), **Lifestyle** (Smoking, Diet), and **Demographics** to derive actionable health insights.

## 🔍 Key Questions & Objectives
The SQL scripts in this repository answer the following critical research questions:
1.  **Demographic Impact:** Does heart attack risk increase linearly with Age? Are biological Males at higher risk than Females?
2.  **Lifestyle Correlation:** How much does Smoking and Obesity contribute to the calculated risk score?
3.  **Comorbidity Analysis:** What is the combined effect of having both Diabetes and High Blood Pressure?
4.  **Geographic Trends:** Which continents show the highest prevalence of cardiovascular issues?
